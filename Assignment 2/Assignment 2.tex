\section*{Fact Scenario B}
\subsection*{Ethical Issues}
As an engineer, you should have reported to your employer/client about this safety issue first instead of going to the designer. As an engineer, you reviewed another engineer's work that is employed by the same client. The chief engineer at Delta Designs did not verify concerns with their drawings.

\subsection*{Rules of Professional Misconduct}
The following Rules of Professional Misconduct apply to this fact scenario:
\begin{description}
	\item[72.2.a] \textbf{negligence.} The chief engineer at Delta Designs displays negligence by refusing to review concerns about the safety and specifications of the gearbox.
	\item[72.2.b] \textbf{failure to make reasonable provision for the safeguarding of life, health or property of a person who may be affected by the work for which the practitioner is responsible.} The chief engineer at Delta Designs refuses to make reasonable provision when reasonable concerns about their work is raised.
	\item[72.2.f] \textbf{failure of a practitioner to present clearly to the practitioner's employer the consequences to be expected from a deviation proposed in work, if the professional engineering judgment of the practitioner is overruled by non-technical authority in cases where the practitioner is responsible for the technical adequacy of professional engineering work.} You failed to inform your employer/client about the concerns about the design.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Codes of Ethics}
The following Codes of Ethics apply to this fact scenario:
\begin{description}
	\item[77.7.ii] \textbf{A practitioner shall, not accept an engagement to review the work of another practitioner for the same employer except with the knowledge of the other practitioner or except where the connection of the other practitioner with the work has been terminated.} You have reviewed the designs of Delta Designs without the knowledge of the engineers at Delta.
\end{description}

\subsection*{Decision Making Options and Solutions}
Possible decision making options and solutions that were available to you include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Do not directly reach out to Delta Designs and instead inform your client of the situation first, and wait to hear back from your client on what to do. In the meantime, do not manufacture the gearboxes due to the potential safety risk. This would address any ethical issues that arise due to violating Rules of Professional Misconduct and Codes of Ethics which require you to inform your client/employer about deviations in work, and for violations for reviewing another practitioner's work without their knowledge. Informing your client first is also the recommended under the Engineer's Duty to Report guidelines in Professional Engineers Ontario's Professional Engineering Practice Guideline.
\end{enumerate}
Possible decision making options and solutions that were available to the chief engineer at Delta Designs include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Investigate the concerns raised by you about the design of the gearboxes.
\end{enumerate}
